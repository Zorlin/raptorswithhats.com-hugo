I'm going to be straight to the point: I'm going to try and switch to the Everyman Sleep Schedule.

This will be achieved by going from "monosleep" to "segmented sleep" (two 3.5 hour core sleeps), to dual core sleep (3.5h + 1.5h + nap) with the midday nap where one of your E3 naps will be. Finally, the transition to full E3 - 3.5 hours, followed by 3x20 minute naps.

Wish me luck - I'm going to start tonight.
