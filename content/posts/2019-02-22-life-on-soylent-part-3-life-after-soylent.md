My experiences with Soylent stopped in early 2015 as I moved back to Australia. 
(Click the "soylent" tag if you want to read my previous posts on Soylent).

I thought I'd give a quick writeup on my troubles getting Soylent in Australia. 

I tried the Aussielent vanilla powder, which I didn't like. Not sure why.

I tried Primalkind for a while, and liked it, but couldn't keep it up and didn't like the texture.

At this stage I'm honestly just holding out hope that "real" Soylent comes to Australia soon. I might try making some recipes myself or maybe try a few different vendors.

I'm on traditional food fulltime at the moment.
