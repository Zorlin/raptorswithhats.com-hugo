Bringing the remaining two nodes (inky and clyde) online today.

Etched the latest available XU4 image.

There are some tweaks we should make before we get started.
https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-xu4/troubleshooting/shutdown_script

inky booted as 10.1.1.145
created static lease for 10.1.1.203
set rootpw appropriately
set hostname
apt install netatalk
test ssh root@inky.local

created mfs user - adduser mfs
created /lfsbrick/ folder
installed xfsprogs
created xfs filesystem on /dev/sda
mkdir /lfsbrick/moosebox and chown mfs:mfs

Time to setup users.

root@blinky:~# adduser wings
root@blinky:~# usermod -aG sudo wings

Install prereqs for moosefs
sudo apt install build-essential libpcap-dev zlib1g-dev libfuse-dev pkg-config automake fuse checkinstall

Grab MooseFS - https://github.com/moosefs/moosefs/archive/v3.0.101.tar.gz
tar xvf it, run Linux build, and as root checkinstall

Set up mfschunkserver, mfshdd, mfsmetalogger and mfsmount configs

Start chunkserver + metalogger and enable them

That's initial setup done.

Rinse and repeat for clyde.

Done!
