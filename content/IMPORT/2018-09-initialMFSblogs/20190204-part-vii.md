I did a clean shutdown of the entire cluster, for the second time.

inky and clyde failed to come back up.

I kept trying various things to fix them, but in the end I plugged the SD cards from both into my Chromebook, then unmounted them.

I suspect the cheap microSD cards I'm using on those two might be dodgy. Will monitor to see if it happens again.

In the meantime I should probably invest in a serial cable for the HC2s.
