going to try moosefs today

need to install their recommended pkgs
maybe need to install automake too?

/root/moosefs/missing: line 81: aclocal-1.15: command not found
WARNING: 'aclocal-1.15' is missing on your system.
         You should only need it if you modified 'acinclude.m4' or
         'configure.ac' or m4 files included by 'configure.ac'.
         The 'aclocal' program is part of the GNU Automake package:
         <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake>
         It also requires GNU Autoconf, GNU m4 and Perl in order to run:
         <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf>
         <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
         <http://www.perl.org/>

MooseFS was a huge success.
133MB/s write speeds and handled the workloads I need perfectly.

I used checkinstall to uninstall it without too much fuss.

Now building the latest LizardFS... I suspect if libjudy is not installed
it falls back to something worse. Also, same with boost. Unfortunately
building LizardFS takes a long-ass time.

installed libjudy-dev
installed libboost-system-dev
installed libboost-program-options-dev
installed libsystemd-dev, libcrcutil-dev

tried to build isal
needed yasm and nasm
built and installed isal

installed libdb-dev

screw it
installed libboost-all-dev
installed libpam0g-dev

Finally I have everything needed for 3.12.0 to build :)
We're going to skip Thrift and Polonaise.
git fetch --all --tags --prune
git checkout tags/v3.12.0

Compiled it, installed it, added /opt/lizardfs/bin:/opt/lizardfs/sbin to path
Ran it, still slow as balls.

Building 3.11.3 now.

Same results

Building 3.10.4 now

Same results but a bit faster (33 instead of 26)

Building 3.9.4 now

Same results, bit slower (29)

Building 2.6.0...
